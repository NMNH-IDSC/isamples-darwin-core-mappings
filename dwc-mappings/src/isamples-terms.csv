IdentifierObject,,rdfs:Class,"Object to represent an identified concept; property values from vocabularies with resolvable identifiers for vocabulary terms. Either a label or identifier is required, to allow for cases that a URI is not available.  Data validation process will need to be used for properties that require an identified term value (e.g. has_context_category, has_material_category, has_sample_object_type)."

Curation as used here starts when the sample is removed from its original context, and might include various processing steps for preservation.
