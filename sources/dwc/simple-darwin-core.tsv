This term should not contain identification qualifications, which should instead be supplied in the IdentificationQualifier term.

When applied to a dwc:Organism or dwc:Occurrence, this term should be used in cases where a content provider regards the provided dwc:scientificName to be inconsistent with the taxonomic perspective of the content provider.

genericName	Generic Name	The genus part of the dwc:scientificName without authorship.	For synonyms the accepted genus and the genus part of the name may be different. The term dwc:genericName should be used together with dwc:specificEpithet to form a binomial and with dwc:infraspecificEpithet to form a trinomial. The term dwc:genericName should only be used for combinations. Uninomials of generic rank do not have a dwc:genericName.	`Felis` (for scientificName `Felis concolor`, with accompanying values of `Puma concolor` in acceptedNameUsage and `Puma` in genus)	http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/Taxon	http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#Property	http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/genericName

The term dwc:infragenericEpithet should be used in conjunction with dwc:genericName, dwc:specificEpithet, dwc:infraspecificEpithet, dwc:taxonRank and dwc:scientificNameAuthorship to represent the individual elements of the complete dwc:scientificName. It can be used to indicate the subgenus placement of a species, which in zoology is often given in parentheses. Can also be used to share infrageneric names such as botanical sections (e.g., `Vicia sect. Cracca`).	`Abacetillus` (for scientificName `Abacetus (Abacetillus) ambiguus`); `Cracca` (for scientificName `Vicia sect.

infraspecificEpithet	Infraspecific Epithet	The name of the lowest or terminal infraspecific epithet of the dwc:scientificName, excluding any rank designation.	In botany, name strings in literature and identifications may have multiple infraspecific ranks. According to the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (Schenzhen Code Articles 6.7 & Art. 24.1), valid names only have two epithets, with the lowest rank being the dwc:infraspecificEpithet. For example: the dwc:infraspecificEpithet in the string `Indigofera charlieriana subsp. sessilis var. scaberrima` is `scaberrima` and the dwc:scientificName is `Indigofera charlieriana var. scaberrima (Schinz) J.B.Gillett`.

cultivarEpithet	Cultivar Epithet	Part of the name of a cultivar, cultivar group or grex that follows the dwc:scientificName.	According to the Rules of the Cultivated Plant Code, a cultivar name consists of a botanical name followed by a cultivar epithet. The value given as the dwc:cultivarEpithet should exclude any quotes. The term dwc:taxonRank should be used to indicate which type of cultivated plant name (e.g. cultivar, cultivar group, grex) is concerned. This epithet, including any enclosing apostrophes or suffix, should be provided in dwc:scientificName as well.	`King Edward` (for scientificName `Solanum tuberosum 'King Edward'` and taxonRank `cultivar`); `Mishmiense` (for scientificName `Rhododendron boothii Mishmiense Group` and taxonRank `cultivar group`); `Atlantis` (for scientificName `Paphiopedilum Atlantis grex` and taxonRank `grex`)	http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/Taxon	http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#Property	http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/cultivarEpithet
taxonRank	Taxon Rank	The taxonomic rank of the most specific name in the dwc:scientificName.	Recommended best practice is to use a controlled vocabulary.

taxonomicStatus	Taxonomic Status	The status of the use of the dwc:scientificName as a label for a taxon. Requires taxonomic opinion to define the scope of a dwc:Taxon. Rules of priority then are used to define the taxonomic status of the nomenclature contained in that scope, combined with the experts opinion. It must be linked to a specific taxonomic reference that defines the concept.	Recommended best practice is to use a controlled vocabulary.	`invalid`; `misapplied`; `homotypic synonym`; `accepted`	http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/Taxon	http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#Property	http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/taxonomicStatus
nomenclaturalStatus	Nomenclatural Status	The status related to the original publication of the name and its conformance to the relevant rules of nomenclature. It is based essentially on an algorithm according to the business rules of the code.
