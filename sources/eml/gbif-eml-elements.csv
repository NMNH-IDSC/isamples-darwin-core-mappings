abstract,A brief overview describing the dataset
acknowledgements,"One or more sentences that acknowledge funders and other key contributors to the study (excluding the dataset authors listed in the creator field). Note that funding awards are also listed by award number in the award section, which provides a structured list of funders, award numbers, and award URIs for the dataset."
additionalInfo,Any information that is not characterized by the other resource metadata fields
additionalMetadata,A flexible field for including any other relevant metadata that pertains to the resource being described. This field allows EML to be extensible in that any XML-based metadata can be included in this element.
address,The address field is a container for multiple subfields that describe the physical or electronic address of the responsible party for a resource.
administrativeArea,"The administrative area field is the equivalent of a 'state' in the U.S., or Province in Canada. This field is intended to accommodate the many types of international administrative areas."
alternateIdentifier,This is the only identifier issued by the IPT for the metadata document; it is a UUID
associatedParty,A party associated with the resource. Parties have particular roles.
attributeOrientation,"Specifies whether the attributes described in the physical stream are found in columns or rows. The valid values are column or row. If set to 'column', then the attributes are in columns. If set to 'row', then the attributes are in rows. Row orientation is rare, but some systems such as SPlus and R utilize it. For example, some data with column orientation: DATE PLOT SPECIES 2002-01-15 hfr5 acer rubrum 2002-01-15 hfr5 acer xxxx The same data in a rowMajor table: DATE 2002-01-15 PLOT hfr5 SPECIES acer rubrum acer xxxx"
award,"The award field is used to provide specific information about the funding awards for a project in a structured format. Sub-fields are provided for the name of the funding agency, the Open Funder Registry identifiers for the agency and program that made the award, the award number assigned, the title of the award, and the URL to the award page describing the award. In general, the funding agency should be listed with a cross-reference to the appropriate identifier from the Open Funder Registry (included in the EML distribution but updated periodically from the Open Funder Registry)."
awardNumber,"The awardNumber field provides the unique identifier used by the funder to uniquely identify an award. These are typically alphanumeric values that are unique within the system used by a given funder. The number should be listed using the canonical form that each funder uses to express its award numbers, and not be prefixed or postfixed with extra text such as the acronym of the funder or the name of the funder, which is available instead in the funderName field."
awardUrl,"Typically, the awardUrl is use to find and locate the award, and generally addresses the internet location to find out more information about the award. This should point to a funder site for the award, rather than a project site."
beginDate,A single time stamp signifying the beginning of some time period
beginRange,"The lower value in a range of numbers. Use to represent an exact number by omitting the ""endRange"" value."
bibliography,A list of citations that form a bibliography on literature related / used in the dataset
bibtex,"The bibtex field provides a parseable list of citations formatted according to the Bibtex formatting conventions. Each citation entry is assigned a unique key that must be unique across all bibtex fields in the EML document. The citation key can be used in markdown sections of the text to refer to this citation using the pandoc-style of inline citation keys. See the markdown element for more details. The record is delimited using curly braces. Most reference software can both import and export citations in Bibtex format, so this is a simpler representation to produce and consume than native EML citation representations."
boundingCoordinates,"Bounding Coordinates are the four margins (N, S, E, W) of a bounding box, or when considered in lat-lon pairs, the corners of the box."
calendarDate,"The calendar date field is used to express a date, giving the year, month, and day. The format should be one that complies with the International Standards Organization's standard 8601. The recommended format for EML is YYYY-MM-DD, where Y is the four digit year, M is the two digit month code (01 - 12, where January = 01), and D is the two digit day of the month (01 - 31). This field can also be used to enter just the year portion of a date."

commonName,"Applicable common names; these common names may be general descriptions of a group of organisms if appropriate, e.g., invertebrates, waterfowl"
complex,"A complex text format that can describe delimited fields, fixed width fields, and mixtures of the two. This supports multiline records (where one record is distributed across multiple physical lines). When using the complex format, the number of textFixed and textDelimited elements should exactly equal the number of attributes that have been described for the entity, and the order of the textFixed and textDelimited elements should correspond to the order of the attributes as described in the entity. Thus, for a delimited file with fourteen attributes, one should provide exactly fourteen textDelimited elements."
country,The country field is used for the name of the contact's country.
coverage,"Describes the extent of the coverage of the resource in terms of its spatial extent, temporal extent, and taxonomic extent"

funderIdentifier,"The funder identifier is used to provide one or more canonical identifiers that reference the funder. These identifiers should be globally unique. The most common form of a funder identifier is a DOI identifier of an institution or program drawn from the CrossRef Open Funder Registry (https://gitlab.com/crossref/open_funder_registry), which assigns DOIs to each funding agency and to their programs, and links these together in a navigable hierarchy. A copy of the current Funder Registry is included as an RDF file with EML for reference, but as the list is constantly growing, users can retrieve new copies of the RDF file to get updates and current metadata about funders."

Multiline records are usually delimited with two line ending characters, for example on UNIX it would be two linefeed characters (\n\n). As line delimiters are often non-printing characters, one can use either the special value ""\n"" to represent a linefeed (ASCII 0x0a) and ""\r"" to represent a carriage return (ASCII 0x0d). Alternatively, one can use the hex value to represent character values (e.g., 0x0a). If this value is not provided, processors should assume that the physical line delimiter is the same as the record delimiter."

The record delimiter is usually a linefeed (\n) on UNIX, a carriage return (\r) on MacOS, or both (\r\n) on Windows/DOS. Multiline records are usually delimited with two line ending characters, for example on UNIX it would be two linefeed characters (\n\n). As record delimiters are often non-printing characters, one can use either the special value ""\n"" to represent a linefeed (ASCII 0x0a) and ""\r"" to represent a carriage return (ASCII 0x0d). Alternatively, one can use the hex value to represent character values (e.g., 0x0a)."
