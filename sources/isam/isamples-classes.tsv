Agent	Object to represent a person who plays a role relative to sample collection or curation.
GeospatialCoordLocation	A physical location in decimal degrees using EPSG\:4326. Could be sample point location, or the centroid of a sampling area. Elevation is specified as a string that should include the measure, units of measure, and the vertical reference system, e.g. 'above mean sea level', 'below ground surface', 'below sea floor'...
IdentifierObject	Object to represent an identified concept; property values from vocabularies with resolvable identifiers forvocabulary terms. Either a label or identifier is required, to allow for cases that a URI is not available.  Data validation process will need to be used for properties that require an identified term value (e.g. has_context_category, has_material_category, has_sample_object_type).
Keyword	A simple string (tag) useful for guiding discovery of the sample, or a scoped name that associates the keyword string with a scheme name,and optional scheme URI and value URI. The scoped name keywords can be used to categorize the sample using a formal vocabulary. This mechanism provides the hook to use extension vocabulariesfor domain specific concepts extending the context, material type and object type high-level vocabularies.
MaterialSampleCuration	Information about the current storage of sample, access to sample, and events in curation history. Curation as used here starts when the sample is removed from its original context, and might include various processing steps for preservation. Processing related to analysis preparation such as crushing, dissolution, evaporation, filtering are considered part of the sampling method for the derived child sample.
MaterialSampleRecord	This is a data object that is a digital representation of a material sample, and thus shares the same identifier as the physical object. It provides descriptive properties for any iSamples material sample, URI for the metadata record is same as URI for material sample-- digital object is considered twin of physical object, a representation. IGSN is recommended. Must be a URI that can be dereferenced on the web.
SampleRelation	Semantic link to other samples or related resources.
SamplingEvent	Information about the event resulting in the creation of the material sample. Include information about permitting in the authorized_by property. The sampling procedure should be described in the description. If any special protocols were followed in the sampling procedure, they should be documented using the MaterialSampleRecord/complies_with property.
SamplingSite	Documentation of the site where the sample was collected, wtih place name(s) and a geospatial location.
