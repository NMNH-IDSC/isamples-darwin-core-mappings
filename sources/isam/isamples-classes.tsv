Agent	Object to represent a person who plays a role relative to sample collection or curation.	
GeospatialCoordLocation	A physical location in decimal degrees using EPSG:4326. 	Could be point location, or the centroid of a area. Elevation is specified as a string that should include the measure, units of measure, and the vertical reference system, e.g. ‘above mean sea level’, ‘below ground surface’, ‘below sea floor’…
IdentifiedConcept	An identifier with a label, used for vocabulary terms.	
MaterialSampleCuration	Information about the current storage of sample, access to sample, and events in curation history. 	Curation as used here starts when the sample is removed from its original context, and might include various processing steps for preservation. Processing related to analysis preparation such as crushing, dissolution, evaporation, filtering are considered part of the sampling method for the derived child sample.
MaterialSampleRecord	This is a data object that is a digital representation of a material sample, and thus shares the same identifier as the physical object.	It provides descriptive properties for any iSamples material sample URI for the metadata record is same as URI for material sample– digital object is considered twin of physical object, a representation. IGSN is recommended. Must be a URI that can be dereferenced on the web.
SampleRelation	Semantic link to other samples or related resources.	
SamplingEvent	Information about the event resulting in the creation of the material sample.	 Include information about permitting in the authorized_by property. The sampling procedure should be described in the description. If any special protocols were followed in the sampling procedure, they should be documented using the MaterialSampleRecord/complies_with property.
