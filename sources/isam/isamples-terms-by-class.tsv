curation	MaterialSampleRecord	Information about the current storage of sample, access to sample, and events in curation history. Curation as used here starts when the sample is removed from its original context, and might include various processing steps for preservation. Processing related to analysis preparation such as crushing, dissolution, evaporation, filtering are considered part of the sampling method for the derived child sample.	array	
dc_rights	MaterialSampleRecord	a statement about various property rights associated with the resource, including intellectual property rights. Recommended practice is to refer to a rights statement with a URI. If this is not possible or feasible, a literal value (name, label, or short text) may be provided.	string	
description	MaterialSampleRecord	Free text description of the subject of a triple.	string	
has_context_category	MaterialSampleRecord	Top level context, based on the kind of feature sampled.

At least one value is an instance of skos:Concept from the iSamples sampled_feature_type.	array	
has_material_category	MaterialSampleRecord	The kind of material that constitutes the sample. At least one value is an instance of skos:Concept from the iSamples material_type Vocabulary; extension vocabularies can be used for more precise categorization.	array	
has_sample_object_type	MaterialSampleRecord	The kind of object the material sample is. At least one value is an instance of skos:Concept from the iSamples material_sample_object_type Vocabulary; extension vocabularies can be used for more precise categorization.	array	
keywords	MaterialSampleRecord	free text terms or formal categories associate with sample to support discovery. As in DataCite metadata, each keyword is a separate element. Multiple keywords should NOT be included as a comma-delimited list.	array	
label	MaterialSampleRecord	a human intelligible string used to identify a thing, i.e. the name to use for the thing; should be unique in the scope of a sample collection or dataset.	string	
produced_by	MaterialSampleRecord	object that documents the sampling event--who, where, when the material sample was obtained	string	
registrant	MaterialSampleRecord	identification of the agent that registered the sample, with contact information. Should include person name and affiliation, or position name and affiliation, or just organization name. e-mail address is preferred contact information.	array	
related_resource	MaterialSampleRecord	link to related resource with relationship property to indicate nature of connection. Target should be identifier for a resource.	array	
sample_identifier	MaterialSampleRecord	URI that identifies the material sample described by this record	string	
sampling_purpose	MaterialSampleRecord	term to specify why a sample was collection.	string	
description	SampleRelation	Free text description of the subject of a triple.	string	
label	SampleRelation	a human intelligible string used to identify a thing, i.e. the name to use for the thing; should be unique in the scope of a sample collection or dataset.	string	
relationship	SampleRelation	term to identify realationship between host sample and the sample relation target. Should be controlled vocabulary (ScopedName). for now start with string, 'derivedFrom'.	string	
target	SampleRelation	identifier for the target resource in the relationship. Start with string, should be Identifier object.	string	
authorized_by	SamplingEvent	a list of permits or other formal permission documents under which the sample was collected. Use to cite legal documents authorizing sample collection.	array	
description	SamplingEvent	Free text description of the subject of a triple.	string	
has_feature_of_interest	SamplingEvent	What does the sample represent.	string	
identifier	SamplingEvent	a string that identifies some resource. Expectation is that it is a URI that is resolvable to some useful represenation of the resource.	string

project	SamplingEvent	the name or identifier for a project that is the sponsor for a samplingEvent. Use to link samples collected in the context of a particular project. We do not have a preferred project model at this point; the RAID effort (ISO23527, https://www.raid.org.au/) will hopefully mature into a registry we can use for project identification and metadata. Property value should be a name or a resolvable URI.	string	
responsibility	SamplingEvent	Agent object includes person name, person identifier, affiliation, or organization name, their role relative to the parent element.	array	
result_time	SamplingEvent	Date on which the sample was collected. Can be YYYY, YYYY-MM, xsd:date, or xsd:dateTime.	string	
sampling_site	SamplingEvent	object that identifies the place where the sample was collected	array	
description	SamplingSite	Free text description of the subject of a triple.	string	
identifier	SamplingSite	a string that identifies some resource. Expectation is that it is a URI that is resolvable to some useful represenation of the resource.	string
