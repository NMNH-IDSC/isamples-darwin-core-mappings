Analytical preparation		Specimen is a product of processing required for some observation procedure, e.g. thin section, XRF bead, SEM stub, rock powder. If identified separately, this should have a ‘parent’ link to the original sample		Research product		https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/specimentype/1.0/analyticalpreparation
Anthropogenic aggregation		Aggregation consists of fragments of material produced by human activity,  not described individually, and generally not all originating from the same object.  Includes pottery in an excavation unit that gets an aggregate description, production waste, production raw-materials, or other residues (broken bits of plaster from a destroyed wall), synthetic powders.		Any aggregation specimen		https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/specimentype/1.0/anthropogenicaggregation
Any aggregation specimen		Sample consists of a bunch of material fragments, not related to the same object (e.g. not a bunch of broken pot sherds that might be reassembled), but taken together representative of the sampled feature. Examples: loose soil, sediment, crushed rock,  particulate, bunches of unrelated pot sherd, human production waste, filtrates and residues. The sample requires some kind of container to keep it together. Cores of loosely consolidated material are considered Solid material specimen because the internal parts have spatial relationships (e.g. upper part, lower part, sedimentary structures).		Physical specimen	AFQ_0000306	https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/specimentype/1.0/anyaggregation
Artifact		An object made (manufactured, shaped, modified) by a human being, or precursor hominid. Include a set of pieces belonging originally to a single object and treated as a single specimen.	A sample is classified as an artifact if it is intended to represent the manufactured item.  For example, core, thin section, peel, glass slide smear are products of human manufacture, but are intended to represent materials or biological specimens.	Non biologic solid object		https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/specimentype/1.0/artifact
Any biological specimen		Specimen for which the sampled feature is one or more living organisms from a particular biome context, megascopic or microscopic		Physical specimen		https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/specimentype/1.0/biologicalspecimen
Biome aggregation sample		Specimen is an aggregation of whole or fragmentary parts of multiple organisms, microscopic or megascopic, representative of some site.		Any aggregation specimen > Any biological specimen		https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/specimentype/1.0/biomeaggregation
Bundle biome aggregation		An aggregation of whole organisms representative of some biome		Biome aggregation sample		https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/specimentype/1.0/bundlebiomeaggregation
Experiment product		Specimen is product of an experimental procedure (e.g. synthetic material)		Research product		https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/specimentype/1.0/experimentalproduct
Fluid in container		Specimen is a container whose contents are liquid, gas, or mixed dominantly fluid phases that is the actual sample material. Fluid might include minor solid particles. Container typically human made, but also includes natural fluid container, e.g. fluid inclusion in a mineral grain.  Includes colloids, foams, gels, suspensions. The sample is the fluid substance; fluid samples collected to analyze the contained biome should be considered Biome Aggregation		Physical specimen		https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/specimentype/1.0/fluidincontainer
Fossil		Specimen is the remains of one or more organisms preserved in rock; includes whole body, body parts (usually bone or shell), and trace fossils. An organism or organism part becomes a fossil when it has undergone some fossilization process that generally entails physical and chemical changes akin to diagenesis in a sedimentary rock. Includes trace fossils, which are manifestations of biologic activity preserved in a rock body (typically sedimentary), without included preserved body parts.	There are many processes that lead to fossilization, including permineralization, casts and molds, authigenic mineralization, replacement and recrystallization, adpression, carbonization, and bioimmuration (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil).	Non biologic solid object		https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/specimentype/1.0/fossil
Aggregation		An aggregate specimen that is not biogenic or composed of anthropogenic material fragments.  Examples: loose soil or sediment (e.g. in a bag), rock chips, particulate filtrate or precipitate; rock powders.		Any aggregation specimen		https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/specimentype/1.0/genericaggregation
Non biologic solid object		Individual solid object, not formed directly by or part of a living organism		Physical specimen		https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/specimentype/1.0/nonbiologicsolidobject
Organism part		Part of an organism, e.g. a tissue sample, plant leaf, flower, bird feather. Include internal parts not composed of organic material (e.g. teeth, bone), and hard body parts that are not shed (hoof, horn, tusk, claw).  Hair is tricky, include here for now.  Does not necessarily imply existance of parent sample. Not fossilized; generally includes organism parts native to deposits of Holocene to Recent age.		Any biological specimen		https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/specimentype/1.0/organismpart
Organism product		Specimen is a thing produced by some organism, generally not composed of organic material or including biological tissue, e.g. Shell, antler, egg shell, coral skeleton (organic tissue not included), fecal matter, cocoon, web.  Consider internal parts not composed of organic material (e.g. teeth, bone) and hard body parts that are not shed (hoof, horn, tusk) to be organism parts.

Other solid object		Single piece of material not one of the other types.		Non biologic solid object		https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/specimentype/1.0/othersolidobject
Physical specimen	material sample	A material entity that represents an entity of interest in whole or in part (http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/MaterialSample) . Top concept in material sample type type hierarchy.  Represents any physical specimen (material sample).				https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/specimentype/1.0/physicalspecimen
Research product		Specimen is a product of some research workflow, e.g. a thin section, an XRF pellet, a grain mount, SEM stub, synthetic rock or mineral ...  In general there should be a link to a parent specimen from which this was derived.  Might be aggregation (e.g. a synthetic material powder) or a solid object.		Physical specimen		https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/specimentype/1.0/researchproduct
Slurry biome aggregation		specimen consists of mixed organic and inorganic material, including whole organisms and organism fragments.		Biome aggregation sample		https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/specimentype/1.0/slurrybiomeaggregation
Solid material specimen		Individual solid object, not formed directly by or part of a living organism, that is representative of some material.	"Many sediment cores consist of non-consolidated or weakly consolidated material, but are considered solid objects if the core is preserved intact to observe the sedimentary structures and particle relationships within the sediment. If this material were disaggregated into a mass of granular material to put in a bag, it would become an aggregate (spec:genericaggregation).	e.g. a rock or mineral specimen, a specimen of some manufactured material, a meteorite. Ice and permafrost are considered solid materials."	Non biologic solid object		https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/specimentype/1.0/solidmaterialspecimen
Whole organism specimen		Specimen consists of the bodies of one or more entire organisms of the same species, from any kingdom. Note that these are also inherently solid object		Any biological specimen		https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/specimentype/1.0/wholeorganism
