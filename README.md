# Semantic Mappings of the iSamples Model to the Darwin Core Standard

This repository contains semantic mappings of the iSamples Model to Darwin Core (DWC) and Darwin Core Data Package (DWC DP). Reported mappings adhere to the [Simple Standard for Sharing Ontology Mappings (SSSOM)](https://mapping-commons.github.io/sssom/) specification. 

This repository contains the following semantic mapping sets:
1. [dwc-mappings] iSamples Model (sssom:object_source) and (Simple) Darwin Core (sssom:subject_source) - ***Complete***
2. [dwc-dp-mappings] iSamples Model (sssom:object_source) and the latest version (as of 2025-02-22) Darwin Core DP (sssom:subject_source) - ***Under Review***
   
Each mapping set contains the following files
1. YAML File containing a serialization of the MappingSet object
2. Tab-delimited file containing the mappings block (individual mappings)
