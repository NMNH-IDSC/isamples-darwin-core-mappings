# Semantic Mappings of the iSamples Model to the Darwin Core Standard
[isamples-dwc-mappings](https://github.com/ben-norton/isamples-dwc-mappings)

Reported mappings adhere to the Simple Standard for Sharing Ontology Mappings (SSSOM) specification.

This repository contains the following semantic mapping sets:
1. [dwc-mappings] iSamples Model (sssom:object_source) and (Simple) Darwin Core (sssom:subject_source) - ***Complete***
2. [dwc-dp-mappings] iSamples Model (sssom:object_source) and the latest version (as of 2025-02-22) Darwin Core DP (sssom:subject_source) - ***Under Review***

In addition, the [sources](https://github.com/ben-norton/isamples-dwc-mappings/tree/main/sources) folder contains all associated source files for the semantic mappings.

Each mapping set contains the following files
1. YAML File containing a serialisation of the MappingSet object
2. Tab-delimited file containing the mappings block (individual mappings)
